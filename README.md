This library provides React components to build web applications based on [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

## Getting Started

Install the [react-spatial package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spatial):

```bash

```

Your build pipeline needs to support ES6 modules and SASS.

## How to use `npm link`

If you want to use, for development purpose, this project with `npm link`:

```bash
cd react-spatial
yarn symlink
cd ../your_project
yarn link react-spatial
```

Then on every change you have to re-rerun `yarn build` or `yarn symlink`

If you project use webpack, set the [`resolve.symlinks`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-symlinks) options to `false`, in your webpack config file.

If you use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) without ejecting, you have no choice than temporarly modify the webpack config in the `node_modules` folder.

```bash
vim react-spatial/node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js
```

Any ideas to make this properly is welcome !!!
